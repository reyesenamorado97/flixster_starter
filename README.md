### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

I would say that the labs helped a significant amount. Mainly lab 3 was the one of most assistance due to the fact that we got to use an API as an example.
Implementing the modal pop-ups was the one feature I felt unprepared to complete, but I'm sure with more time and practice, it should be possible.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

I definitely would tried to implement the modal pop-up feature. I knew had to grab all the relevant information from the API, but the modal itself was what I could not make appear.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

All that I really wanted to implement after every core feature was done was the pop-ups.
I would have loved to add smaller features like color-coded ratings and a button at the bottom of the page that would send the user to the top.
